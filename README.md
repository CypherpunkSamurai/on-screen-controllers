# pnpm

```

#### Joystick Controller

JoyStickController is a virtual joystick that can be used to control the movement of an object in a 2D space. The controller can be customized with different colors, sizes, and sensitivity levels. The `onInputCallback` function is called whenever the joystick is moved, providing the x and y coordinates of the thumbstick within the range of -1 to 1.

```typescript
import { JoystickController } from "on-screen-controllers";

const joystick = new JoystickController({
	container: document.getElementById("joystick-container"),
	radius: 100,
	color: "#CCC",
	thumbColor: "#333",
	onInputCallback: (x: number, y: number) => {
		console.log(`Position: x=${x.toFixed(2)}, y=${y.toFixed(2)}`);
	},
});
```

#### D-pad Controller

DpadController is a directional pad that can be used to control the movement of an object in 9 directions (`up`, `down`, `left`, `right`, `up-left`, `up-right`, `down-left`, `down-right`, `center`). The controller can be customized with different colors, sizes, and callback functions. The `onPressCallback` function is called whenever a direction is pressed.

```typescript
import { DpadController } from "on-screen-controllers";

const dpad = new DpadController({
	container: document.getElementById("dpad-container"),
	radius: 150,
	colorBase: "#4a4a4a",
	colorPressed: "#2a2a2a",
	onPressCallback: (direction: string) => {
		console.log(`Direction: ${direction}`);
	},
});
```

#### Button Controller

ButtonController is a simple button that can be used to trigger an action when pressed. The controller can be customized with different colors, sizes, and an optional icon. The `onPressCallback` function is called whenever the button is pressed.

```typescript
import { ButtonController } from "on-screen-controllers";

const button = new ButtonController({
	container: document.getElementById("button-container"),
	width: "80px",
	height: "80px",
	color: "#3498db",
	pressedColor: "#2980b9",
	icon: "path/to/icon.svg", // Optional
	onPressCallback: () => {
		console.log("Button activated");
	},
});
```

#### Retractable Slider

RetractableSlider is a vertical or horizontal slider that can be used to outpu a value when moved. The controller can be customized with different colors, sizes, and callback functions. The `onSlideCallback` function is called whenever the slider is moved, providing the current value between 0 and 100.

```typescript
import { RetractableSlider } from "on-screen-controllers";

const slider = new RetractableSlider({
	container: document.getElementById("slider-container"),
	direction: "vertical",
	height: "200px",
	color: "#e74c3c",
	trackColor: "#c0392b",
	onSlideCallback: (value: number) => {
		console.log(`Value: ${value.toFixed(2)}`);
	},
});
```
